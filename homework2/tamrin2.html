                        <p>The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club
                            association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations
                            (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners
                            through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a
                            single leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third
                            most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and
                            the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and
                            the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league
                            champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

                                <p>First contested in 1992/93, the UEFA Champions League has become synonymous with the
                                    very
                                    best strikers in world football history, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi,
                                    Robert
                                    Lewandowski and Karim Benzema able to rack up stellar goal tallies.

                                    Ronaldo and Messi are the only players to date to score over 100 goals in the
                                    competition, and like the remaining players in the all-time European Cup/Champions
                                    League top ten, neither featured in the competition when it was still the European
                                    Champion Clubs' Cup.


                                    That competition, first launched in 1955/56, was knockout ties all the way, the lack
                                    of
                                    a group stage meaning players had fewer matches per season in which to score. Real
                                    Madrid contested just seven games as they won the inaugural edition, compared to 13
                                    en
                                    route to their Champions League victory in 2022/23.
